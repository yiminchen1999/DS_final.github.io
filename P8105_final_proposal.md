### Tentative Title: Central Park Squirrel Data Analysis

### Data sources:

- [City of New York Squirrel Census
  2018](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2018-Central-Park-Squirrel-Census-Squirrel-Data/vfnx-vebw)

### Motivation

- Squirrels are everywhere, but is there a trend of where they prefer to
  stay with respect to their color, age, activities and all other
  features? Doing an analysis using squirrel census data may answer the
  question. Based on the results of the investigation we can compile
  relevant charts and make reasonable exploits, prevention or prediction
  based on information about squirrel habitat and activity patterns in
  Central Park.

### Intended final products

- A written report summarizing results of investigations

- A webpage containing motivation, introduction, questions and analyses,
  visualizations with interpretations and explanations (tables, graphs,
  interactive map, etc.), discussion, conclusions and next steps,
  limitations, and references.

- Reasonable usage scenarios for the website can be provided, for
  instance: Sometimes we might want to have a picnic or an event in
  Central Park but don’t want to be disturbed by a ton of squirrels.
  Based on our results, a location with less squirrels could be
  discovered as the venue. Researchers who want to collect data related
  to squirrel habits can accurately find the location of squirrels and
  related data through our results. Or he can directly extract and
  reference useful information about correlation of relationships
  between specific behaviors and age or color from our results.

- A video introducing our webpage in details

### Analyses, visualizations, and challenges

- analyses: Find location distribution of squirrels in Central Park
  in 2018. Analyze the frequency for squirrel sightings by different fur
  colors. Investigate the relationship of behavior observation and age &
  fur of squirrels. ANOVA Test/ T-test- whether behavior are associated
  with age & fur of squirrels Construct data model to predict the
  behavior/habitat of a specific squirrel

- visualizations: Interactive map: Relative habitat of the squirrels in
  Central Park that match the filter Scatter Plot (Smooth): Whether
  specific behaviors of squirrels generate (increase) trends according
  to age Plot: Does the combination of squirrel’s fur color produce a
  certain regularity of habitat or cluster effect?

- coding challenges: some information needs to be further interpreted in
  the raw dataset. For example, in the column of “Above Ground Sighter
  Measurement”, some entries are ‘FALSE’ or blank. Also, in the column
  of “Hectare”, what different entries represent for and how do we
  visualize it?
